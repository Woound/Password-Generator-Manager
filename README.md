# Password-Generator-Manager
A Password Generator and Manager project.
This is my first attempt at learning File Handling in Java through making a project.
The program allows the User to generate 'x' number of Randomized passwords, whose characters are taken from the ASCII characters set.
It then allows the user to store the passwords in a file and output the passwords if they wish to  retrieve them.

I plan on adding Encryption to the passwords in the future and improve the program as I learn more.
